Sysfs Entries
=============

The following sysfs entries are provided by the Jailhouse Linux driver. These
can be used for monitoring the state of the hypervisor and its cells.

/sys/devices/jailhouse
|- enabled                      - 1 if Jailhouse is enabled, 0 otherwise
|- mem_pool_size                - number of pages in hypervisor memory pool
|- mem_pool_used                - used pages of hypervisor memory pool
|- remap_pool_size              - number of pages in hypervisor remapping pool
|- remap_pool_used              - used pages of hypervisor remapping pool
`- cells
   |- <name of cell>
   |  |- id                     - unique numerical ID
   |  |- state                  - "running", "running/locked", "shut down", or "failed"
   |  |- cpus_assigned          - bitmask of assigned logical CPUs
   |  |- cpus_failed            - bitmask of logical CPUs that caused a failure
   |  `- statistics
   |     |- vmexits_total       - Total number of VM exits
   |     `- vmexits_<reason>    - VM exits due to <reason>
   `- ...

Note that statistics are accumulated non-atomically over all CPUs of a cell and
may not reflect a fully consistent state. The existence and semantics of VM
exit reason values are architecture-dependent and may change in future
versions. In general statistics shall only be considered as a first hint when
analyzing cell behavior.
