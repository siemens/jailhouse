Inter-Cell communication of the Jailhouse Hypervisor
====================================================

The hypervisor isolates cells but sometimes there is a need to exchange data
between cells. For that purpose Jailhouse provides shared memory and signaling
between cells.

One channel is always between exactly two cells, there is no 1:n or n:m
communication.

The interface used between the cell and the hypervisor
------------------------------------------------------

One end of such a communication channel is modeled as a PCI device that a cell
can discover on it's PCI bus. The device model used closely follows the
"ivshmem" device known from Qemu (see qemu docs/specs/ivshmem_device_spec.txt
and https://gitorious.org/nahanni/).
The device implemented by jailhouse supports MSI-X for signaling. While the
spec would allow for multiple interrupts, Jailhouse supports exactly one per
virtual device.

The ivshmem device implemented by the jailhouse hypervisor is different to the
mentioned specification in several regards. One is that the location and the
size of the shared memory region itself are not encoded in a PCI BAR. Device
drivers get the relevant information by accessing custom PCI config space
registers. See hypervisor/pci_ivshmem.c IVSHMEM_CFG_SHMEM_* or the ivshmem demo
in the inmates directory.

To facilitate state synchronisation between cells, two additional MMIO
registers are provided:

    Offset  Size    Access      Reset   Function
    16      4       read/write  0       Local state (LSTATE)
    20      4       read-only   0       Remote state (RSTATE)

Local state: Current value is visible as RSTATE in the connected cell.
Writes trigger the doorbell as by writing to the Doorbell register.

Remote state: Returns the current value of the LSTATE register in the
connected cell, zero if no peer is connected.

Moreover, the PCI Class Code field of the Jailhouse ivshmem device differs from
the one used by the original device. The base class code (top byte) is 0xff.
The subclass code (middle byte) is tunable via the cell configuration to encode
the protocol that the connected cells are expected to implement over the shared
memory. The programming interface code (low byte) is tunable as well and is
supposed to encode possible revisions of that protocol.

Adding Inter-cell communication to cells
----------------------------------------

In order to set up a communication channel between two cells you first have to
add a memory region to both cells. Add a read/write region with matching size
and physical address to both cells. Non-root cells sharing memory with the
root cell need the memory flag "JAILHOUSE_MEM_ROOTSHARED" on the region.
To allow cells to discover shared memory and send each other MSIs you also
need to add a virtual PCI device to both cells. The "type" should be set to
"JAILHOUSE_PCI_TYPE_IVSHMEM" and "shmem_region" should be set to the index
of the memory region. "num_msix_vectors" should be set to 1 and for your root
cell config you should make sure that "iommu" is set to the correct value,
 try using the same value that works for the other pci devices.
The link between two such virtual PCI devices is established by using the same
"bdf". The size and location of the shared memory can be configured freely but
you have to make sure that the values match on both sides. The "shmem_protocol"
has to match as well.
For an example have a look at the cell configuration files of qemu and the
ivshmem-demo.

Demo code
---------

You can go ahead and connect two non-root cells and run the ivshmem-demo. They
will send each other interrupts.
For the root cell you can find some test code in the following git repository:
