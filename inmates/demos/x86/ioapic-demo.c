 * WARNING: This is just a demo, using a commonly available resource. IRQ 9
 * is bluntly stolen from Linux while it may still listen to this source in
 * the ACPI driver. Even when destroying the cell, Linux won't regain control
 * as it won't reprogram the IOAPIC. Moreover, the IRQ might be shared with
 * other devices which will lose their IRQs when starting this cell.
 *
 * Strong recommendation: Avoid using legacy interrupt for non-root cells!
 * Many of them can't be isolated easily from other other cells - if at all.
